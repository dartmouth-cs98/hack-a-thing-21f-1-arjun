# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I wrote a simple c program (`random.c`), compiled it to WebAssembly (`random.wasm`, not committed because its binary) using [WebAssembly Explorer](https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/), and loaded that into a simple website (`index.html`) using the JavaScript fetch api.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

:-)

## What you learned

I learned that while the words used to describe what WebAssembly is and what it does well are kinda complicated, actually integrating it into a simple webpage isn't too difficult. On the other hand, it's not very clear how to integrate dynamic WebAssembly components or more complicated C libraries and function into a simple webpage; I'd like to work on that next.
